So, you've got text and you want it to talk? Well, aren't you just living in the future! Welcome to the Text-to-Speech Conversion Project where your dreams of making text vocal are about to come true. Prepare to be amazed (or mildly amused)!

## ✨ Features
- 📚 Convert your boring old text into thrilling audio. Because who has time to read nowadays?
- 🎤 Choose from a variety of voices to give your text some personality. Because why settle for one voice when you can have many?
- 🤖 Multilingual support, because communication knows no bounds.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- 🐍 Python 3.11. If you're still stuck in the Python 2 era, it's time to let go.

    ```
